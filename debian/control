Description: a Common Lisp window manager
 StumpWM is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
 attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
 keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars,
 tool bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.
 .
 These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
 customizable lisp based systems.
 .
 Please ensure that you install compatible implementations of CL and
 CLX.  That means either install sbcl and cl-clx-sbcl or cmucl and
 cmucl-source or clisp only.
 .
 The suggested package, slime, lets you control a running StumpWM
 session through Emacs.
